                FTP is a set of rules that for exchanging files over the internet. Unlike HTTP which is used to ask for the entire webpage and it's files to display them, FTP is used only to move a file from one computer to another. FTP is commonly used by web developers when they want to tranfer their local files from their computer to the server and vice versa.

                Web browsers and web servers communicate using HTTP. HTTP has rules for exchanging different types of files like text, images, audio, and video. When a browser is directed to a hyperlink, an HTTP request is built and sent to the server of that URL which then processes the request and responds by sending the requested files.

                The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information.

                The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)Takes a proactive role in developing recommendations and prototype technologies related to the Web. These recommendations are not rules but guidelines. Major software companies that build web browsers, such as Microsoft, do not always follow W3C Recommendations. This makes life challenging for web developers because not all browsers will display a web page in exactly the same way.

                When you use a highlighter to mark a word in a textbook, you are marking it up. If you create a system where different color highlights indicate different types of information, you will have created a markup language.

In the context of the internet and computers, a markup language is a system for marking up or annotating a digital document so that the information it it can be structured for more easy access and manipulation.

                SGML is a standard for defining a markup language and specifying tag sets. SGML is not itself a markup langauge. HTML and XML are based on SGML. The latest version of HTML5 however is no longer based on SGML syntax despite the similarity.

                HTML is the language used for creating web pages and web applications. HTML has a specified tag set for semantically describing the structure of a web page. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page and are defined by tags written using angle brackets.

                XML is a human and machine readable markup language for storing and transporting data. It looks very similar to HTML, having opening and closing tags with attributes, but the tags are user defined. Developers can create any tag they need to describe information. All xml documents must have a root element. XML is not a replacement or alternative to HTML.

XHTML is an evolution of HTML with the formatting strengths of HTML 4.01 and the structure and extensibility strengths of XML. The syntax for XHTML is more strict than that of HTML. XHTML has now been replaced by HTML5.

HTML5 is the latest standard markup language for the web. It incorporates features of it's predecessors and adds new elements, provides new features, and is backward compatible.
